# UserEndCryptography  
    
    # Project Name

Overview
This repository contains the user-end cryptography component of our academic project focused on enhancing cloud security. The goal of this component is to provide end-to-end encryption and decryption functionalities for user data in the cloud, ensuring that data remains secure and confidential even in a shared cloud environment.

## About

This project's goal is to implement an automated, secure method of encrypting data
before uploading it to AWS S3 and decrypting the data from AWS S3. The project's
goal is to investigate the drawbacks of AWS SDK encryption as well as the
advantages of using Python crypto libraries for encryption, including improved
portability, flexibility, and control. The project also aims to show how well this method
works at protecting data and minimizing manual.


The project also aims to develop a methodology for client-side encryption
implementation using Python crypto libraries, which includes identifying the data that
needs to be encrypted, choosing the encryption algorithm and key management
system, implementing the encryption process using Python crypto libraries,
automating the encryption process using Python, managing the encryption keys
appropriately, and monitoring the encryption and decryption processes.
